## What are the reasons for giving the The Nobel Prize in Literature to Bob Dylan?

We display the manifold references of Bob Dylans Song texts from a selection of five his songs.

`print-one-song.R` draws coloured circles for the given csv-file. They display the type of reference in the given timeframe
The script uses the data from the following Spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S7oQ3qfcAKmtVSwdrNj-zjm3_x8Pj9NJzW6lXtZySKA/edit?usp=sharing

`print-all-songs.R` draws images, showing the complete works of Bob Dylan
- How many songs where published by Dylan and which one of those were covers?
- How many songs of Dylan have been covered by others?

The Script uses data created from `get-all-songs-official.R`

`get-all-songs-official.R` scrapes the official dylan-webpage by
- fetching all songs
- the album on which the text was published
- who wrote the song
